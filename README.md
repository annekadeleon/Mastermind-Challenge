# Mastermind Challenge
This game is a challenge from the website [usingpython.com](usingpython.com) which I used to aid in learning how to code with Python during my GCSEs. The list of challenges can be found [here](http://usingpython.com/python-programming-challenges/).

The player enters 4 numbers, and the computer tells the player how many (but not which) of the 4 numbers are correct.

Variations include having a difficulty setting, saving a high score, and saving the name of the user with the highest score.
